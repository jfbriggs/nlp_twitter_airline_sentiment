# Performing 3-Class Sentiment Analysis on Airline-Related Twitter Data

In this Jupyter Notebook project, a selection of airline-related Twitter data from 2015 is cleaned, analyzed, and used to train a selection of models targeted at effectively predicting sentiment (from a selection of positive, neutral, and negative labels).  A selection of scikit-learn algorithms are evaluated through spot-checking.  A limited grid-search is applied, and a basic neural network is compared (using Tensorflow).
